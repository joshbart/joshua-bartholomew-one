# On the joys of Nutella

What is the perfect breakfast?  I'm sure the answer to this question varies greatly from person to person.  But, I found myself asking it a lot this past summer.  My mother and two youngest sisters came to stay at the Bartholomew home off and on from about mid-June to mid-July.  As a good hosts, my wife and I ensured that there was a variety of breakfast options available for them when they woke up. (We, very often, were already at work.)  But it turns out that the youngest of my sisters, Ella, is something of a breakfast snob.  I can't really blame her though.  She's spent a considerable portion of her short life in Belgium and southern Germany, so she's been raised on delicious and sweet European breakfasts.  What is she supposed to think of my meager offerings of Life cereal or Cocoa Pebbles.  In my efforts to try to appease her highly sophisticated tastebuds, I found myself turning to breads and spreads.
